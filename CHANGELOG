 * EasyJ REST
	- Changed lib name to REST
	- Added Exception handlers to answer http status code errors
	- Added testing environment
	- Incorporated EasyJ Validation lib
	- Added primary HTML form mappings to create and edit
	- Added @ViewMappings to map view names for HTML response

 * EasyJ ORM
	- Upgraded Dao and Service to work better, returning useful results, not status strings, and throwing and catching correct exceptions
	- Separated generic orm methods from concrete technology driven implementations

 * EasyJ Http
	- Added support to ignore redirect statuses so that HttpClient doesn't redirect automatically
	


********************************************************
* Version 1.0.3
********************************************************

 - Moved @Transactional annotation to service layer from dao layer

********************************************************
* Version 1.0.2
********************************************************

 - Status code is now returned right from the HttpResponse object that is returned by HttpClient.execute. If there is no response, returns -1.
 - Caches string response once it is requested in consumeString until it is cleared, so you can call consumeString multiple times and it returns the cached string each time.
 - Stopped clearing the EasyClient on consumeString so, the user has to clear it if it plans to use the same object again.

********************************************************
* Version 1.0.1
********************************************************

 - Added some log lines and translated those that were not in english
 - Added a property viewName to UncaughtExceptionHandler so you can customize the exception view name on spring configuration file
